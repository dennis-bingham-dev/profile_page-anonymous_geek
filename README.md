# profile_page

A profile page mock up.

## Getting Started

If you already have flutter installed and using a Mac you can type:
```bash
$ open -a simulator
```
this will open the iPhone simulator on your machine. I have used an iPhone 11 simulator for my testing.

If you need to install flutter see docs here:
[flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

You can run the code by navigating to the location where the code is located after pulling it from github by typing:
```bash
$ flutter run
```

If you are using VScode for development you can click run and then click run without debugging in the drop-down and that will also run the code on the simulator.
